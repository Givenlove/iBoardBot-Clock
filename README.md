# iBoardBot-Clock
Simple console application that draws a clock, and updates it when it changes.
This does not use a so-called API (as i could not find any documentation), but uses the web interface instead. This seems to work just fine until there is a better method for communication.

Commandline usage:

    iBoardBot.exe YOUR_APPID
