# iBoardBot-Clock
Simple console application that draws a clock, and updates it when it changes.
This does not use a so-called API (as i could not find any documentation), but uses the web interface instead. This seems to work just fine until there is a better method for communication.

See iBoardBot.exe.config for the settings.

#### Note:
All fonts can be used, but only fixed with fonts will be optimal.
With other fonts, it might erase and draw more than needed every update due to differences in the widths of each character.
