# iBoardBot-Clock
Simple console application that draws a clock, and updates it when it changes.
This does not use a so-called API (as i could not find any documentation), but uses the web interface instead. This seems to work just fine until there is a better method for communication.

Don't forget to update this line:

    var board = new BoardClient(baseUrl, "YOUR_APIKEY");
